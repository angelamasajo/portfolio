        <li>It's always changing - I'm never bored!</li>

      <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>
          I think software development gives me the best of both worlds. It allows me to problem solve and utilize critical thinking to reach solutions while being creative doing it!
        <p>
          I'm a speech-language pathologist considering myself to be a jack of all trades. In addition to my healthcare and clinical expertise, I also have a diverse background in the areas of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>photography</li>
          <li>graphic design</li>
          <li>social media</li>
          <li>event management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After being in the healthcare field, I realized I really enjoyed working with a multidisciplinary team to reach a common goal. Collaboration and creative problem solving are my specialties!
        </p>
